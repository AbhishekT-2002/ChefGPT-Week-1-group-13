# Weekend Project: Chef GPT

## Overview
This project is a collaborative effort to enhance the Chef GPT script by giving it various unique personalities. Each group member has created a script with a distinct personality for the AI chef. The main script allows users to interact with any of these chefs based on their preferences. The AI chefs can suggest dishes based on ingredients, provide recipes, or critique user-provided recipes.
